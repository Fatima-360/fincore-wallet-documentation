# 📱 EuroFlow User Guide: Managing Your VAT Records

Welcome to EuroFlow! This guide will help you set up your account to automatically generate VAT-compliant invoices for your business.

## 1. Setting Up Your Fiscal Profile
To ensure your tax calculations are accurate, you must first complete your profile:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Business Profile**.
2. Enter your **Legal Business Name** and **Registered Address**.
3. Input your **VAT ID Number** (if applicable). Our system will verify this via the EU VIES database in real-time.

## 2. Generating a VAT-Compliant Invoice
Every time you receive a payment, EuroFlow generates a digital record:
* **Automatic Detection:** Our system identifies your customer’s location to apply the correct EU VAT rate.
* **Download Instructions:**
    1. Go to the **Transactions** tab.
    2. Click on any completed payment.
    3. Select **"Download Tax Invoice (PDF)"**.

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Why is the VAT rate different for different customers?**
A: Under the **EU VAT Directive**, digital services are taxed at the rate of the *customer's* country, not yours.

**Q: Can I edit an invoice after it is generated?**
A: No. To maintain audit-ready records, invoices are locked once issued. If you need to make a change, you must issue a **Credit Note**.
