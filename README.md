🏦 Project: EuroFlow Regulatory & User Documentation Suite
Role: Fintech Technical Writer (Compliance & UX)
Core Skillset: Docs-as-Code | Regulatory Documentation | Information Architecture
📖 Project Context
EuroFlow is a cross-border Fintech platform designed for EU-based SMEs. As the platform scaled, it required a rigorous documentation overhaul to meet EU VAT Directive requirements and to reduce user friction during the high-stakes "Tax Reconciliation" period.

The Problem:
Compliance Risks: Internal teams lacked a standardized SOP for VAT auditing.

Onboarding Friction: Users struggled with the technical complexity of generating fiscal reports.

Documentation Silos: Product info was scattered, making updates difficult for engineers.

🛠 My Documentation Strategy
I implemented a Docs-as-Code workflow to ensure the documentation lived alongside the software, allowing for version-controlled, audit-ready updates.

Audience Analysis: Segmented content for two distinct groups: Internal Audit Teams (Technical SOPs) and End-User Business Owners (UX-focused Guides).

Plain Language Conversion: Translated dense financial regulations (like the EU VAT Directive) into "Plain Language" for non-expert users.

Structured Information Architecture: Built a logical hierarchy to ensure a < 3-click path to any specific tax regulation or user task.

📂 Documentation Deliverables
This repository contains three pillars of the EuroFlow ecosystem:

[Internal] VAT Reconciliation SOP: A high-compliance document for finance teams to ensure 100% audit accuracy.

[External] EuroFlow User Guide: A step-by-step manual for generating VAT-compliant financial records.

[Reference] The Fintech Glossary: A standardized dictionary of SaaS and Tax-Tech terminology to align engineering and legal teams.

🚀 Impact & Outcomes
Audit Readiness: Established a 100% compliant documentation framework for EU financial audits.

Efficiency: Reduced the documentation update cycle by integrating the workflow into GitHub.

Support Reduction: Drafted "Self-Serve" guides designed to reduce customer support tickets during tax season.

💻 Technical Stack
Language: Markdown (for high scannability and portability).

Version Control: Git & GitHub (Branching, Commits, Pull Requests).

Workflow: Docs-as-Code.
